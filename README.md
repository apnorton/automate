Tools for the automatic creation of Java code. (In progress...)

I have often heard it said "if you are bored coding, then you're doing tasks that you should have automated."  This is my first attempt at automating my code development process.

In academic settings, it is common for an instructor to specify a class name, as well as several fields and methods that should be in the class.  The "ClassCreator" program converts an input file of fields, method headers, and constructor outlines into a compilable Java program (with method skeletons, accessors, mutators, and simple constructors).
